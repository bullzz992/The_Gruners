                \section{Introduction}
                		This document contains a detailed specification how the augmented reality project is going to be carried out by the Gruners group. It will specify both functional and non-functional requirements and the architectural design for the application and quality requirements. All these will be coupled with use cases for a particular system functionality and the testing thereof. This document will use an agile methodology in a sense that it will be updated as per functionality requirement from the client.

                \section{Vision and Scope}
                		\subsection{Vision}
                				The vision of the project is to develop a mobile application for smart phones that will enable the phone to detect vehicle number plates using a camera view and then overlaying on the display the information of the scanned vehicle. This application will then be used by mobile units to track vehicle statuses. 
                		\subsection{Scope}
                			
                				The envisioned system is a mobile application, with a web front-end, which will allow the permittted users to do the following:
                			    		\begin{itemize}
                								\item scan through number plates with the android phone
                				                \item receive the resulting information in a user-friendly display.
                				                \item make all relavent CRUD operations, using a user-friendly web interface..
                				                
                			            \end{itemize}
                		
                \section{Architectural Requirements Specification}
                		\subsection{Access Channels }
                				The envisioned system must be accessible by human users via the Android application and Web browsers.
                			
                		\subsection{Quality Requirements}
                		
                				\subsubsection{Performance}
		   			                  	The system must offer fast performance in detection of vehicle number plates as well as retrievals from the database.
		   			                  	
                			    \subsubsection{Accuracy}
                			    		Number plate detections must be at accurate. Detections made on non-stationary vehicles must be possible.
                			    		             	
                				\subsubsection{Auditability}
		   			                   	The system must maintain audits for all vital operations. These audit logs can then be provided upon request. 
		   			            		%The feature to store a scanned vehicle whose info is not yet in the DB
		   			            		
                				\subsubsection{Scalability}
	   			                   		The system must allow multiple users to make use of the application without interruptions. This holds for both the Android application and the web application.
		       			                  	
               					\subsubsection{Maintainability}
					                  	All layers of the system must be developer-friendly. - That is, the design and development of the system must allow smooth maintenance of all the system's counterparts.
       						    
       						    \subsubsection{Usability}
			    	                  	The system must allow all users to be able to interact with it without any major difficulties.
       						    	                  	
                
                		\subsection{Architecture Constraints}
                				
                				\begin{itemize}
                						\item The mobile application has to run on the Android OS with the target being Android 4.4 but allowing for compatibility with older versions up to Android 4.0.3. 
                						\item The MVC (Model View Controller) architecture pattern is to be used throughout the project.
                				\end{itemize}
               
                \section{Software Architecture Specification}
                
               		 \subsection{Architecture Requirements}
               		   
                			\subsubsection{Quality Requirements}
                					\begin{itemize}
                							\item Performance
	                								\begin{itemize}
						   			                  		\item Number plate detection must take less than 5 seconds.
						   			                  		\item Retrieval of information from the database must take no longer than 1 second.
						   			                \end{itemize}
                								
                							\item Accuracy
			              							Number plate detections must be at least 99\% accurate. Detections made on non-stationary vehicles must be possible for vehicles at most 20 metres away from the scanning device.
               								
                							\item Auditability
		               								\begin{itemize}
		               									\item The system will make audits of all operations that alter the database. .
		               									\item The system will also maintain a history of all number plate scans successfully done.
		               								\end{itemize}
		               								
		               								
                							\item Scalability
                									\begin{itemize}
					       				                  	\item The system must be able to scan all types of Southern African number plates.
					       				                  	\item The system must be able to operate effectively and efficiently under a load of 100 concurrent android application users or 100 concurrent web interface users.
					       			                \end{itemize}
		               								
                							\item Maintainability
                									To implement maintainability, the system will make use of a layered architecture that separates certain counterparts such that maintaining a subsystem does not, in any means, affect any other subsystem.
		              								
                							\item Usability
                									An average user must be able to use the system without any further training or extensive manual consultation required. This will be achieved by the use of design principles to enhance user experience.
		               								
                							
                					\end{itemize} 
                			 
                			\subsubsection{Integration and Access Channel Requirements}
                					These are the dirrent channels through which the system can be accessed by all related users.
	                				The system will be accessible by human users through the following channels:
	                				
			                    	\begin{enumerate}
					                    	\item From the web browser throuch a user-friendly web interface. This implies that the system must be accessible from all widely used web browsers (including the most recent versions of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari and Microsoft Internet Explorer).
					                    	\item From mobile android devices using the Android application.
			                    	\end{enumerate}  
			                    	  
                			\subsubsection{Architecture Constraints}
                					The following architecture constraints will be followed mainly for maintainability reasons:
                					\begin{enumerate}
                							\item All system counterparts must be developed and attached to a JAVA RESTful Web Service.
                							\item The business logic layer must provide an API for access to the SQL Database.
                							\item The system will make use of the MySQL database.
                							\item The mobile client must run on an Android application.
                							\item The system functionality will be hidden in a RESTful web services such that it is not exposed to any presentation layer counterpart.
                					\end{enumerate}
                				
                			  
                	\subsection{Architectural patterns or Styles}
                			For the sake of good high-level responsibility separation and allowance for reuse of lower level layer components across components in higher level layers, a layered architecture will be used for this system.
                			The layered architecture for the system contains the following layers:
                			\begin{itemize}
		                			\item Client Layer
		                			\item Access Layer
		                			\item Business Processes Layer
		                			\item Domain Objects Layer
		                			\item Backend Layer
                			\end{itemize} 
                			
                			
                			\begin{figure}[h]
                                   \centering

                			The responsibility allocation across the layers is as follows:
                			\begin{enumerate}
                					\item Provide access to humans: Client Layer
                					\item Provide access to system functionality to human access layer and other systems: Access Layer
                					\item Business Logic Encapsulation: Business Processes Layer
                					\item Provide domain objects: Domain Objects Layer
                					\item Hosting Database: Backend Layer
                			\end{enumerate}

                \section{Functional requirements and application design}
                    \subsection{Introduction}
                    This section discusses all the functional requirements for the CSIR Augmented Reality Number Plate Recognition system.
                    
                    \subsection{Required functionality}
                    		\subsubsection{Number Plate Detection}
                    				The system's core function relies on the detection of number plates. The system allows the user to pan through the environment with their mobile phone. When the camera lens gets to a vehicle number plate, the application makes a detection of the number plate by scanning the digits character for character within the number plate region.
                    			
                    			
                    		\subsubsection{Storing Locally}
                    				Once the mobile app has made a scan, this use case is triggered. The system needs to keep record of all the scans the user has made. So the system will store the stored number plate characters onto a local database. The system will then create a request for a database fetch of information related to the scanned number plate.
                    		
                    		\subsubsection{Data Retrieval}
                    				Data Retrieval may be triggered either by the user or by the system as a sequence of use cases. Its function is to take a request and fetch all information related to the requested number plate. The retrieved data is stored onto the local database for display.
                    		
                    		\subsubsection{Results Output}
                    				This function fetches the retrieved data from the local database. This data must be displayed on the screen as the camera's focus is on a scanned number plate whose details have been retrieved from the remote database. 
                    				
                    				
                    		\subsubsection{Data Management}
                    				This functionality is made available for the web application for management users. The function of this use case is to perform all CRUD on the remote database as well as viewing audit trails.
                    				
                    		\subsubsection{Audit Log}
                    				This functionality makes sure that every operation that all kinds of users perform within the system are recorded. It is triggered upon successful completion of an operation.
                    				
                    \subsection{Use case prioritization}
                    		\subsubsection{Critical}
                    				The following use cases are considered critical:
                    				\begin{itemize}
	                    					\item Number Plate Detection
	                    					\item Data Retrieval
	                    					\item Results Output
                    				\end{itemize}
                    				
                    		\subsubsection{Important}
                    		The following use cases are considered important:
                    				\begin{itemize}
		                    				\item Data Management
		                    				\item Audit Log
		                    				\item Storing Locally
                    				\end{itemize}
